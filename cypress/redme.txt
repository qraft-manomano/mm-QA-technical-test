This project has been developed with cypress and cucumber.

You must install first cypress via npm with the comand:
npm install cypress

After finish the installation, copy from path /cypress repository into your local repository inside /cypress/cypress/.

To execute the project, use in cypress terminal in the path /cypress/:
node_modules\.bin\cypress open --browser chrome

To open the server and click on DemoBlaze.feature.

I did't use integrated testing only UI testing.
